# RP4K Pizza Bandit
This is a game I made with RP4K (Real Programming for Kids) in 2017. It was one of the first games I ever made and it was the first game I ever made with a real GUI.

# How do I play it?
You can download the origonal executable by clicking [here](https://github.com/GrantBGreat/RP4K-Pizza-Bandit/releases/download/v1.0/Pizza_Bandit.exe), or view releases [here](https://github.com/GrantBGreat/RP4K-Pizza-Bandit/releases). Your browser may flag the executable as dangerous, but I promise it is not. If you dont belive me, go see for yourself with the source code above. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

# What can I do with it?
Play around with the code. Do whatever you want with this code, there is nothing stopping you. _You may even find some fun speed multiplyer varibables._ üëÄ

# Will you be updating this?
Pizza Bandit is an old game I created back in 2017 and I have no intention of updating it. As I said above, I have no problem with you taking and modifying this code so do as you please.
